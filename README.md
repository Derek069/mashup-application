# Mashup-app

<h2>Description:</h2>

This mashup application is a web page developed with JavaScript using React that consumes the MarvelAPI to gather data about comics But also, consumes an API developed by the members of the team. The team decided to make an API filled up with data of different Marvel series, so the application can use its data.
